# WebRTC-User Introduction

Greetings mentors, 
This repository contains the code for the redesigned WebRTC app for the task. 

In order to view this, you need to do these steps:

1. Clone this repository (.zip for .git)
2. Redirect to the root folder in your command panel
3. Run "bower install" to install all the polymer components
4. run "Polymer serve" (assuming you have Polymer installed)
5. Open your browswer and insert this link: "localhost:8080"

Or you could view the website here:

I've already described the designs (with pictures) in the GCI comment sections. 

Hope you have a nice day! :D
