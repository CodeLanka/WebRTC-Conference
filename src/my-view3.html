      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>WebRTC-Conference is a progressive web application which provides users participating in a conference the ability to listen to a session done in a foreign language in a language familiar to the user, by tuning into a channel which broadcasts the same session in the language of your choice.</p>

<li>It is so easy for using this app. First you can open the WebRTC-Conference progressive web app and select your conference which you want to listen.</li>
<li> you canâ€™t understand the language you can switch the language from a section. So you can understand easily.</li>
<li>For a conference, your listening is very important and WebRTC provides a new and easy way to get in touch everyone in the conference.</li>
